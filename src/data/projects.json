The customer needed to be able to iterate over the content quickly, adding projects and experiences on the fly. We opted for a CMS using Python and Django, chosen for it’s simple admin panel and authorization system. This was fronted with Django’s REST api framework, allowing us to separate the concerns of the project. The REST api is consumed on the front-end using AngularJS.</p>",
