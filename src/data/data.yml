paragraphs: 
  - I’m a Web Developer and Technologist. 
  - I’ve always had an interest in technology and computing and two years ago, I embarked on a programming career that’s been an exciting journey so far. Whether I’m creating products and tools that make life that little bit easier or unlocking the secrets of a dataset. I relish the chance to solve a complex problem.
  - Initially inspired by undertaking a programming centric final major project for my Music Technology degree. I turned to the web, as a stage to expand my knowledge, allowing me to couple my creativity with technicality. 
  - Working for smaller companies has given me insight into the priorities and challenges a project is faced with. It is essential for projects to be maintainable and writing modular, testable code using test-driven principles is one way I try and achieve this balance. Deploying code quickly and reliably also plays a large factor and I am currently using a combination of Docker, Git, GitLab and AWS to accomplish this.
  - The web is an ever-changing landscape, keeping up with its fast-paced nature is essential. I am currently researching and exploring functional programing paradigms and I’m interested in seeing how these are applied in the JavaScript oriented language Elm. What excites me in the future? I think VR has the potential to play a large part in how we consume information. It will provide companies with a new platform to offer tangible and stimulating user experiences. 
  - I am currently on the lookout for new and exciting opportunities and challenges, so if you are interested in hiring me, check out the following links
